            An Autoethnography: Health Wearable Technology</h3>
           <p>I. Data Collection Process  Introduction</p>
            <p>I have grasped a thorough understanding of what digital culture is and how it affects day to day life. My understanding is derived from my practical experiences as well as the refined research and discussion I have been exposed to in class. I have chosen to specifically examine health wearable technology. In my case I reflected on and tracked my use of an Apple Watch. This topic challenged me to utilize my knowledge on a technology not extensively explored during lectures or within readings.</p>
           <p>Notable Features of an Apple Watch</p>
           <p>• Activity log - showing activity progress in standing, exercise, and activity </p>
           <p>• Monitors heart activity</p>
           <p>• Monitors blood oxygen levels</p>
           <p>• Tracks sleeping habits and quality of sleep</p>
           <p>• Tracks ovulation cycle</p>
           <p>• Offers a mindfulness feature – option to log emotions throughout the day  
           <p>Data Collection Method</p>
           <p>Over the duration of a week, I used a journal to track my use of health wearable technology. Each entry included a title, the date, the time of day, a description of the experience, a reasoning for the experience, an emotion felt after the experience, as well as the information collected by the technology during the experience. For this data collection method to be applicable I carried a journal and a pen with me whenever possible. I found the patience to record thoroughly my experiences to ensure my data collection would be most accurate. </p>
           <p>Method Choice Reasoning</p>
           <p>Choosing to use a journal tracking method was a very involved but thoughtprovoking method. Throughout the week I took time to record and describe my experiences in detail. This forced me to consider my research topic and engage in selfdiscussion.</p>
           <p>II. Data Collection Results</p>
           <p>Reviewing my experiment results allowed me to consider the strengths and faults of health wearable technology. My recordings offered extensive evidence to support my ideas and deductions. I believe that the way in which I utilize my Apple Watch positively affects both my mental and physical wellbeing, although safety measures in data collection and privacy should be assessed.</p>
           <p>Highlight Data Results</p>
           <p>Title; Mindfulness Feature. Date / Time of Day; 10/04/2023 - 3:24PM. Description; Here I logged in my mindfulness feature that I was feeling tired. Reasoning; This is significant because I use this feature to track my state throughout the day due to my iron deficiency. This health concern affects my energy levels and changes day-to-day. Emotion; After establishing that I was tired, I then had a snack, took a nap and felt refreshed after waking up. Collected Data; My watch knows at what time of day I feel tired</p>
           <p>Title; Tracking a Workout. Date / Time of Day; 10/02/2023 - 11:30AM. Description; I did an at home arm workout for 30 minutes and used the exercise tracking feature on my watch. Reasoning; By tracking my workout, I later see results on my health statistics, and it adds to my activity rings. Emotion; After completing my workout and seeing my results I feel accomplished. Collected Data; My watch knows that I did a workout, what time I did a workout, and my health results prior to my workout.</p>
           <p>Title; Sending My Results! Date / Time of Day; 10/02/2023 - 12:04PM. Description; Here I sent my workout results to my sister; a contact I have linked on my watch. Reasoning; This feature allows me to share my workouts with my friends, offering a sense of community, Emotion; After sending my workout results to my sister and her responding with a thumbs up, I felt accomplished and supported. Collected Data; My watch knows who I am sending my workouts to and has access to a list of my friends that I communicate with</p>
           <p>Reflection</p>
           <p>My findings suggest that technology can thrive in a controlled environment. The health wearable technology that I examined is an example of a technology that offers emotional and physical affordances while also holding the possibility to be less invasive in users' privacy and security. Emotions and physical health thrive while using health wearable technology due to its refined features. It offers a fitness community for users to indulge in. Sharing workout results, taking calls, and receiving text messages allows people to connect and creates a communicative culture around technologies like the Apple Watch. This community gives users a sense of belonging. 
             The watch also encourages users to improve their physical health. The ‘activity rings’ give wearers a sense of accomplishment which feeds into and utilizes our cognitive system. The watch’s many features follow the Self-Regulated Learning system which is comprised of, “five cognitive operations, including searching, monitoring, assembling, rehearsing and translating (SMART),” (Zhang & Wilson, 2023, p. 2). The structure of this system allows for the Apple Watch to reshape and guide how users operate the device. As proved in the recent study with breast cancer survivors, health wearable technology, “may lead to improved attitudes about participants’ own health 
             and wellbeing, reductions in anxiety, and improvements in HRQoL [Health Related Quality of Life] factors;” (Blount et al., 2021, p. 14). The devices being designed to offer only the most necessary features of a smartphone create a healthier way of connecting through technology. It was proven during the study that, “checking moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity data on a phone or computer did not yield the same positive attitude results” (Blount et al., 2021, p.14). Due to the intentionally crafted and controlled environment, health wearable devices, such as the Apple Watch, have become a viable, more positive way to connect using technology. Health 
             wearable technology holds the opportunity to offer a safe and controlled environment for users. Leitão (2019) mentions that the main reason for online vulnerability may, “be related to the usability of security and privacy” (p. 529). Moving forward, taking privacy matters more seriously in the production of the Apple Watch will make this the ultimate socially and physically rewarding technology while also upholding security measures. Users have limited access to larger sites, such as Google, that are notorious for collecting big data. Not having the freedom to explore online sites that monitor behaviours helps to avoid and diminish instrumentation. This sets 
             the devices apart from other invasive and controlling technologies such as computers, smartphones, tablets and smart homes.  The Apple Watch, taking form in the shape of a traditional watch, and mimicking its classic behaviours is an example of convergence culture (Harley, 2023). The digital watches visibly differ from the look of other devices, which sets the tone for the different, more cultivated user experience that it presents. I believe that the watch has more potential than any other device to offer true privacy. Implementing responsibilities on companies producing these devices is the first step. Zook et al.’s (2017) ten simple rules for responsible
             big data research should be strenuously followed focusing on a strong code of conduct and sense of ethics. Marketers should also seek to spread awareness. As mentioned in the Leitão article, (2019) precautions such as privacy and security information and visualizations, improved visual and auditory affordances, robust multi-user support, and usability and privacy and security controls should be included in health wearable technology and should be advertised to all users (p. 534-535).  
             <p>Conclusion</p>
           <p>My experiment allowed me to exercise my knowledge of digital culture and its effects on us as a society. I discovered and explored the ramifications of health wearable
             technology and found that it deviates from other, more common devices. I understand that great technologies blend into our everyday life without our notice and that an Apple Watch may take a more positive take on the concept. Health wearable devices have the potential to offer a beneficial and safe way of implementing technology into everyday life while contained in a controlled environment.</p>
